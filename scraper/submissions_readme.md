# Homework 01

This is the submissions repository for CSCI 104 [hw01](http://bits.usc.edu/cs104/assignments/hw1/) in Spring 2015.


### How to Grade a Submission
1. Clone the repository to have a local copy. To clone this repository, run the following command:
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:usc-csci104-spring2015/submissions_hw1.git
```

1. Individual student repositories use the following naming convention: `hw_usc-username` where `usc-username` is the USCNet username of the student who owns that repository. `hw` stands for Homework.

### What is This Repository
This repository uses [git submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules) which means that it does not host code locally in the repository, but rather it links to the specific commits for this assignment submission. Think of it as a repository of repositories.

On the [GitHub UI](https://github.com/usc-csci104-spring2015/submissions_hw1), you will notice each student has two links associated to their submission displayed in the format: `hw_ttrojan` @ `58d4a4c`. Clicking on `hw_ttrojan` will take you to their **current** repository whereas clicking on `58d4a4c` will take you to **their assignment submission**.

**Please be mindful of the distinction.**
