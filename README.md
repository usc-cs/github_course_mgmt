# Github Course Management Tools

This repository hosts a number of scripts and tools that helps the TA to run a GitHub-based course based on GitHub. Specifically:

- *org_mgmt* populates a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations) with a list of students, and creating private repositories for each of them
- *scraper* scrapes homework submissions from students' repositories, either based on a deadline time or a specific SHA.

Please refer to the READMEs of each subfolder to find out more.
